# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** file a public issue to report a security vulnerability, instead send your report privately to **[hudson@ziroau.com](mailto:hudson@ziroau.com)**. This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that are found can be [disclosed responsibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) to any affected parties. We do not award bounties for security vulnerabilities.
